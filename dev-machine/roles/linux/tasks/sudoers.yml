      # As of Debian version 1.7.2p1-1, the default /etc/sudoers file created on
      # installation of the package now includes the directive:
      #
      #       #includedir /etc/sudoers.d
      #
      # This will cause sudo to read and parse any files in the /etc/sudoers.d
      # directory that do not end in '~' or contain a '.' character.
      #
      # Note that there must be at least one file in the sudoers.d directory (this
      # one will do), and all files in this directory should be mode 0440.
      #
      # Note also, that because sudoers contents can vary widely, no attempt is
      # made to add this directive to existing sudoers files on upgrade.  Feel free
      # to add the above directive to the end of your /etc/sudoers file to enable
      # this functionality for existing installations if you wish!
      #
      # Finally, please note that using the visudo command is the recommended way
      # to update sudoers content, since it protects against many failure modes.
      # See the man page for visudo for more information.
